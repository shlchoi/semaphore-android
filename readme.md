## About Semaphore

Despite the increasing popularity of email and instant messages for communication between parties, physical mail is still in use today for packages, government-issued identification, and other documents. In 2014, Canada Post delivered approximately 9.1 billion items to households across Canada. With the phasing out of door-to-door mail delivery and the volume of mail being distributed on an annual basis, problems in mail management have arisen as homeowners must spend time collecting and sorting mail. Physical mail continues to lack some of the benefits of email, such as the ability to be notified of new deliveries, and the ability to distinguish between different types of mail. The existing inefficiencies with collecting and sorting mail can lead to consequences such as fines or service disconnections due to a late or missed payment.

Semaphore aims to be a solution that can assist users in monitoring mailboxes for external and distant properties, like cottages, but also a solution to inform users of when the mailbox for their primary home has received an important letter or delivery.
